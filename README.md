# ALT — 1‑Minute Futures Strategy (Assignment)

👋 **Welcome!** This repository contains my solution to an interview task: design and evaluate a **data‑driven trading strategy** on **1‑minute futures data**, optionally enhanced with **machine learning**.

## 📌 Task & Deliverables

**Task description**  
> According to the interview prompt: *write a trading strategy using 1‑minute futures data, possibly with machine learning.*

**Deliverables**  
1. **`1. exploration+preprocessing_v11.ipynb`** – Data exploration, sanity checks, and preprocessing.
2. **`2. strategy_backtest_v11.ipynb`** – Strategy logic design and historical backtest.
3. **`3. ML_backtest_v10.ipynb`** – Application of machine learning to the problem.
4. **`literature/`** – A few papers related to the proposed strategy (see below).

## 🧠 Method in a Nutshell

A **novel feature** is introduced based on the **Intrinsic Mode Function (IMF)** decomposition (see the attached literature for background).  
- The IMF‑based signal is used in both **algorithmic** (rules‑based) and **machine‑learning** setups.  
- Across the experiments, **both approaches show profitable results** under the tested assumptions.  
- **Conclusion:** IMF features demonstrate **strong potential** for commercial‑grade trading strategies, meriting further research (robustness checks, execution/frictions, and multi‑asset validation).
